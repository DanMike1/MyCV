                <p>Rem units are the new and improved way of sizing the font that one may use the great thing about rem
                    is that one can use rems to have a responsive font layout. Specially when a person has a browser
                    with the capabilities of changing its zoom percentage it becomes more accurate to that of the
                    browser when one uses rem units. </p>

                <article>
                    <p>Even though em and Rem have similarities when it comes to responsiveness em only listens to that
                        of its parents or its root but Rem listens to that of the browsers zoom capabilities. When we
                        come to Percentage for fonts it is unresponsive and the zoom capabilities of the browser will be
                        of no use.</p>

            <p class="title">The new and improved CSS3</p>
            <article>
                <p>The CSS3 is the new Cascading style sheet that has new atributes with the new name. Being the key in
                    web development css has now grown, With new attributes and behaviour it is more simple and quite
                    simply better. Lets dive right in. </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>Css3 has now more colors, it many seem patricularly confusing but what it means is that in the new
                    css it brings for some new ways of describing colours. Prior to CSS3, we almost always declared
                    colours using the hexadecimal format (#FFF, or #FFFFFF for white).The color keyword list has been
                    extended in the CSS3 color module to include 147 additional keyword colors</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>In addition to specifying transparency with HSLA and RGBA colors (and soon, eight-digit hexadecimal
                    values), CSS3 provides us with the opacity property. opacity sets the opaqueness of the element on
                    which it’s declared, similar to alpha.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>In the new css3 rounded corners have been introduced and the border-radius property lets you create
                    rounded corners without the need for images or additional markup. To add rounded corners to our box, we simply add.In CSS3, there’s no need to include an
                    element for every background image; it provides us with the ability to add more than one background
                    image to any element, even to pseudo-elements</p>
